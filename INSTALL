By default, the install script for NQXML creates a directory under Ruby's
`site_local' directory (usually /usr/local/lib/ruby/site_local/X.Y) called
`nqxml'. You may need root permissions to create this directory, depending
upon your operating system. Alternately, you may specify another directory
by using the command line option `--install-dir'.

You can copy the directory nqxml anywhere, as long as your Ruby
installation can find it. For example, you can specify the directory
*above* nqxml in the RUBYLIB environment variable.

Installing NQXML
================

* Extract the distribution. This creates a directory named nqxml-<version>
  (where <version> is the NQXML version number).

    tar -xzf nqxml-<version>.tar.gz
    cd nqxml-<version>

* Run the test suite, if desired (requires RubyUnit).

    cd tests
    ruby -I .. test.rb
    cd ..

* Install NQXML to Ruby's `site_local' directory.

    ruby install.rb

(or)

    ruby install.rb --install-dir=my_directory
